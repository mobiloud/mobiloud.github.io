MobiLoud is not just a plugin, but a "done for you" mobile app service specifically designed for WordPress publishers.

With MobiLoud, you can really build high quality native mobile apps in minutes, and you won’t need any programming skills to get your mobile app published - we take care of the app build and submission for you (on your accounts, or MobiLoud's).

Unlike other solutions, MobiLoud gives you a completely "native" mobile app. Native mobile apps look and feel great on Android and iOS, and don't have the sluggish and glitchy behaviour of non-native mobile apps.

Keep in mind, though, that it works best with content-rich sites, like a blog or news site.

Also, please note MobiLoud is a paid service (see the pricing plans) and includes not just your mobile apps, but a building, publishing and maintenance service, fast technical support and push notifications. On top of fast, beautiful mobile apps, you get everything done for you and a team ready to help.</p>

What some of our customers say about it
"The guys at MobiLoud are amazing.

We can't recommend MobiLoud enough!" ― Stephan Whelan, Founder at DeeperBlue.com

"MobiLoud has made sure that creating a quality mobile app for your blog is as easy and as affordable as setting the blog up in the first place. They're a pleasure to work and offer timely customer service. Today, we enjoy thousands of installs of our mobile apps and control how and when we notify our subscribers of important content through mobile alerts. If you are seeking an elegant mobile solution to accompany your WordPress blog, look no further." ― Jeremi Karnell, Partner & CMO, PTT Research

"They left no stone unturned in making our mobile app perfect! It has been a pleasure working with them." ― Paul Andrew, Founder of Speckyboy Magazine

“I had previously worked with four different mobile app developers and none of them were able to get the job done for me the way I wanted it. It took just two days for MobiLoud to get my WordPress website into an iPhone and Android mobile app." ― Nick Coffey, The Cardinal Connect

"The team at MobiLoud built astonishing mobile apps for the main blogs in our network. Fast development, great support, and of course beautiful mobile apps. What more could we ask for?" ― Fernando Serer, CEO and founder of Blogestudio

"Fantastic plugin and service. We now have a great looking native iPhone app and Android mobile app that stays up-to-date with our site automatically. MobiLoud allowed us to focus on our content without writing a single line of code to get our apps built." ― Luke Wheeler, Editor of Compare The Cloud
